DESCRIPTION: 
            This project is a web-based fake news detection system built using Python, Streamlit, and machine learning. It uses the Passive Aggressive Classifier with TF-IDF vectorization to classify news articles as REAL or FAKE. The user can input any news content, and the model will instantly analyze and display the result. The app also shows the model's training accuracy and provides real-time feedback through a simple UI.
